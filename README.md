# HF Socket Chat Bot

A JavaScript-based chat bot for HackForums socket chat that provides AI responses, YouTube search, and live sports data with odds.

## Features

- **AI Responses** (`/ai`): Uses Gemini API for intelligent chat responses
- **YouTube Search** (`/yt`): Quick video lookup and sharing
- **Live Sports Data** (`/sports`): 
  - Live scores and upcoming games for NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB
  - Game countdowns
  - Live odds from FanDuel and DraftKings
  - Latest league news
- **Rate limiting and cooldowns** to prevent spam
- **User-specific locks** to prevent command abuse

## Commands

- ü§ñ /ai [prompt] - Ask the AI for information/assistance
- üé• /yt [search term] - Search YouTube for videos
- üèÄ /sports [league] - Get live scores, upcoming games, and odds

## API Keys Required

You'll need to provide your own API keys:

## Known Issues / Limitations
